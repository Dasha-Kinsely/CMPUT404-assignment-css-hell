For part one of this project, I changed the background color to orange, which is my favorite color second only to purple.
I rounded the edges of images and gave them a hover effect.
I added underline to header-tags while making the hover effects of the link-tags red.
I also implemented some text-shadows for each words in paragraphs and changed their font-style and font-families.
